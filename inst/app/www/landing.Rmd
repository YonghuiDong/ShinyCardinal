Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a well-established analytical technique that allows direct mapping of a wide variety of chemical classes from different biological samples, providing information concerning analyte identity, relative abundance, and spatial distribution.

<b><span style="color:#d17789; font-size:20px;">ShinyCardinal</span></b> is the web application of R package <a href="https://cardinalmsi.org" target="_new">Cardinal</a>. It is designed to aid researchers in reading, processing, visualizing and analyzing their MSI data. It offers a structured and intuitive workflow, making it a flexible and user-friendly tool for users of all levels.

The workflow includes pre-processing (e.g., missing value imputation, QC-based feature filtering, normalization, transformation and scaling), univariate and multivariate statistical analyses, and visualization of the given metabolomics data. To aid interpretation, a comprehensive HTML report is generated that includes interactive visualizations, tables, summary statistics, and detailed explanations for the users, facilitating an in-depth inspection of the results (Fig. 1).

To assist in preparing input data for MetaboReport, you can use the two demo datasets as reference.

> **Data Set1: MALDI imaging**: 
>
> Description: A 15-micron tissue section of wild type mouse cerebellum was coated with 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) matrix and analysed by MSI in positive ion mode over an m/z range of 300-2000 using a Thermo MALDI LTQ Orbitrap XL instrument. The spatial resolution was 50 micrometers.

> **Data Set 3: DESI imaging**
>
> Description: DESI imaging data were acquired in the negative-ion mode over an m/z range of 200-1050 using a Thermo Exactive instrument (Thermo Scientific GmbH, Bremen, Germany) coupled to a home-built automated DESI-imaging source. All Thermo raw files of one imaging experiment were converted to imzML format using the imzML converter v1.1.4.5i.
