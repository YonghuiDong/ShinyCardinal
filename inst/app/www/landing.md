<b><span style="color:#d17789; font-size:20px;">ShinyCardinal</span></b> is a Shiny web app that that is based R package <a href="https://cardinalmsi.org" target="_new">Cardinal</a>. implements statistical & computational tools for analyzing mass spectrometry imaging datasets, including methods for efficient pre-processing, spatial segmentation, and classification.


is an intuitive, web-based platform designed to streamline the exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis of metabolomics data. It offers a structured and user-friendly workflow, making it a flexible tool for users of all levels.

The workflow includes pre-processing (e.g., missing value imputation, QC-based feature filtering, normalization, transformation and scaling), univariate and multivariate statistical analyses, and visualization of the given metabolomics data. To aid interpretation, a comprehensive HTML report is generated that includes interactive visualizations, tables, summary statistics, and detailed explanations for the users, facilitating an in-depth inspection of the results (Figure 1).

**Features**:

- Pre-processing including normalization, baseline correction, peak-picking and alignment

- Visualization of mass spectra and molecular ion images

- Principal components analysis (PCA)

- Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)

- Classification based on regularized nearest shrunken centroids

- Spatial segmentation via regularized nearest shrunken centroid clustering

To assist in preparing input data for MetaboReport, you can use the two demo datasets as reference.

> **Data 1**: 
>
> Description: A 15-micron tissue section of wild type mouse cerebellum was coated with 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) matrix and analysed by MSI in positive ion mode over an m/z range of 300-2000 using a Thermo MALDI LTQ Orbitrap XL instrument. The spatial resolution was 50 micrometers.
